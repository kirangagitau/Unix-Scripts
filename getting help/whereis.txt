To search for the location of a command or the man pages for a command, use the whereis command. This command searches for commands,
source files and man pages in specific locations where these files are typically stored.
Man pages are easily distinguished from commands as they are typically compressed with a program called gzip, resulting in a filename that ends in .gz

EXAMPLE:

    $: whereis ls
