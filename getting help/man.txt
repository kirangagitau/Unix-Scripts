The developers of UNIX created help documents called man pages (short for manual pages).
Man pages are used to describe the features of commands. They provide a basic description of the purpose of the command, 
as well as details regarding available options.

EXAMPLE:
     $ man ls 

To search a man page for a term, type the / character followed by a search term, then hit the Enter key.
